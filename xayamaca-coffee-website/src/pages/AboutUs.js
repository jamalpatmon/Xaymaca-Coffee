            Xaymaca Coffee Traders was created in 2009 by the patriarch of the
            Levy family, David Levy. He built our company on 2 simple tenets
            excellent customer service and honesty. We, at XCT, will always call
            you back, and we will always tell our customers and partners the
            truth so they can run their businesses effectively. By staying true
            to our values, Xaymaca has become the leading coffee importer and
